# Two-sum_LeetCode
Leet Code #1 Two sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Using two nested for-loops to do a linear search of two different values that sum to equate the given target value. 

O(n^2) time complexity
O(1) space complexity
